This Black Jack game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a fun and interactive way to play the classic card game. To play, simply click the "Start Game" button to receive your first two cards. You can then choose to "New Card" and receive another card. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. This Black Jack game was made possible thanks to the tutorial provided by PEr Herald Borgen on the freecodecamp.org YouTube channel. I am grateful for his clear and concise instructions, which made it possible for me to create this fun and engaging game. Enjoy the game and good luck!
